# Day-Planner

# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Motivation
This task allowed me to become much more comfortable with jQuery, JavaScript, and local storage. I wanted to approach this task with clear goals in mind that would allow me to focus on functionality and work to have purposeful and concise code. 

## The Task

I was tasked with creating a simple calendar application that allows users to save events in a day planner for each hour of the day. I was given HTML and CSS starter code to modify and update dynamically through the power of jQuery.

I was also introduced to the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to have the current date displayed at the top of the page and the time to color-code the planner according to past, present, and future time blocks.


## User Story

I was given the following 'User Story':
```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```


## Acceptance Criteria

This is the 'Acceptance Criteria' that was provided:
```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a time block
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```


## Mock-Up
